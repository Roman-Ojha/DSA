            *) Search Key
                -> (24,52,91,67,48,83)
                -> we search the data in a database in the based of keys. so, we have to store those search keys in the hash table 
            *) Hash table
                -> Hash table is the data structure which provide the method to store the data in proper way
            *) Hash function (k mod 10, k mod n, mid square,folding method)
                -> when we want to insert, search, delete then we don't have to scan, with the help of hash function we can perform in the O(1) time
