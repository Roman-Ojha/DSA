// when you want to insert the data to the linked list that there is a case:
/*  
Case 1: Insert at the beginning
        // Time complexity for to Insert at the beginning will be O(1)
Case 2: Insert in between
        // so, The worst case complexity for to insert in between will be O(n)
Case 3: Insert at the end
        // Time complexity for Insert at the end will be O(n)
Case 4: Insert after the node
        // in this case we can say that where we want to insert we have the pointer given to insert at that node 
        // Time complexity for Insert after the node will be O(1)
