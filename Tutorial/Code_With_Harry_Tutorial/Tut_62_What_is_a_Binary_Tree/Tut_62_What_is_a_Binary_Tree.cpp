    # Binary tree:
        -> those tree whose node degree is 2 or less then 2
        -> binary tree is a tree which has at most 2 children for all the nodes
            1) Tree is made up of nodes and edges
            2) n nodes => n-1 edges
            3) Degree => no of direct children (for a node)
            4) Degree of a tree is the highest degree of a node among all the nodes present in the tree.
            5) Binary tree = Tree of degree <= 2
