/*
    -> Graph Traversal refers to the proces of visiting (checking and/or updaing) each vertex(node) in a graph
    -> Two Algorithms of Graph Traversal are:
        -> Breadth First SEarch(BFS)
        -> Depth First Search(DFS)
    -> In BFS, we start with a node and start exploring its connected nodes. the same process is repeated with all the connecting nodes until all the nodes are visited
