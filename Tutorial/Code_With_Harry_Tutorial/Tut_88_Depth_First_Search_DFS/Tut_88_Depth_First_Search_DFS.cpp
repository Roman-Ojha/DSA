/*
    -> Graph Traversal refers to the proces of visiting (checking and/or updaing) each vertex(node) in a graph
    -> Two Algorithms of Graph Traversal are:
        -> Breadth First SEarch(BFS)
        -> Depth First Search(DFS)
    -> In DFS, we start with a node and start exploring its connected nodes keeping on suspneding the exploration of previous nodes
