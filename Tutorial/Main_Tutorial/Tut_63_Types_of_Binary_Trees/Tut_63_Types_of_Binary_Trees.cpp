    Tree-> Non linear data structure
        -> Ideal for representing hierarchical data
    Linear data structure = Array, Stack, queue, Linked list

    # types of Binary Trees:
        1) Full or Strict Binary tree:
            -> All nodes hava either 0 or 2 children
        2) Perfect binary Tree:
            -> Internal nodes have 2 children
            -> all leaf are on same level
        3) Complete Binary Tree:
            -> All levels are completely filled except possibly the last level
                OR
            -> Must have its keys as left as possible
        4) Degenerate Tree:
            -> Every Parent node has exactly one clild
        5) Skewed Trees
            a) Left Skewed :
                ->  All the childre of left skewed trees are toward left
            b) Right Skewed :
                ->  All the childre of right skewed trees are toward right
